    "content": "Wave 10 Data Collection of the SHARE project started The 10th wave of SHARE-ERIC data collection has begun in October and will continue till March 2025. In Wave 10 contains an innovative project neuroSHARE focusing on early detection of Parkinson and Alzheimer diseases. The neuroSHARE project is prepared in cooperation with researchers from the First Faculty of Medicine at the Charles University and the Czech Technical University. The project consists of a speech, sleep and smell tests collected immediately after the main interview. We are very thankful to all respondents and interviewers for their cooperation. More information can be found at websites of SCaC survey agency.\nneuroSHARE Project in Wave 10 of the SHARE project In the 10th wave of the SHARE project in the Czech Republic we introduce a collection of neuromarkers consisting of three tests: a test of smell, speech and a questionnaire on REM sleep quality in cooperation with the 1st Medical Faculty of Charles University and the Czech Technical University in Prague. For the first time, these tests will be fielded on a large population sample. The goal of the project is early detection of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson and Alzheimer diseases as well as depression, their timely detection and treatment. We are planning even more extensive collection of objective data, so-called biomarkers in Wave 11. This project will be carried out in collaboration with the large RECETOX research infrastructure at Masaryk University in Brno.\nData from Wave 9 of the SHARE project are available for download Data from all countries participating in the 9th wave of the SHARE-ERIC are available for download at https://share-eric.eu/data/data-access, with full documentation https://share-eric.eu/data/data-documentation and other information at https://share-eric.eu/ and http://share.cerge-ei.cz/. Data are in open access in STATA and SPSS formats, with data from national dropoff questionnaire (dropoff, module sharew9_rel9-0-0_dropoff) put together by external researchers cooperating with SHARE-CZ. Data from the HCAP questionnaire will be available in a few weeks.\nField Rehearsal for wave 10 under way in April and May In April and May 2024 the survey agency SCaC is conducting the Field Rehearsal for wave 10. neuroSHARE, a unique project focusing on the early detection of the Parkinson and Alzheimer diseases is also tested. The neuroSHARE project is prepared in cooperation with researchers from the First Faculty of Medicine at the Charles University and the Czech Technical University. The project consists of a speech, sleep and smell tests collected immediately after the main interview.\nNews and innovations in the SHARE project In the 10th wave of the SHARE project in the Czech Republic we are planning several important innovations. The Czech team in cooperation with the SCaC survey agency has successfully completed the collection of HCAP (Human Cognitive Ability Protocol) data on cognition in wave 9 and the collection of accelerometry data in wave 8. Wave 10 will focus on the collection of neuromarkers in the neuroSHARE project. It will consist of a test of smell, speech and a questionnaire on REM sleep quality in cooperation with the 1st Medical Faculty of Charles University and the Czech Technical University in Prague. We are planning even more extensive collection of objective data, so-called biomarkers in Wave 11. This project will be carried out in collaboration with the large RECETOX research infrastructure at Masaryk University in Brno.\nFieldwork in Wave 9 Data Collection of the SHARE project successfully completed In September 2022, the survey agency SCaC successfully completed the 9th wave of SHARE-ERIC data collection. Two important innovations were a part of the 9th wave: the extensive test of cognitive abilities (the Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocol) and the interviewer survey. As always, external researchers placed their own questions in the dropoff questionnaire. We are again very thankful to all respondents and interviewers for their cooperation. More information can be found at websites of SCaC survey agency and here.\nWave 9 Data Collection of the SHARE project has started The 9th wave of SHARE-ERIC data collection continues till the end of summer 2022. The interview is again supplemented by the national dropoff questionnaire and in this wave also by a test of cognitive abilities for some respondents (the Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocol). Besides the Czech Republic, HCAP is also collected in four other SHARE countries. The fieldwork is done by the SCaC survey agency. All interviewers have completed their vaccination against Covid-19. We are very thankful to all respondents and interviewers for their cooperation. More information can be found at websites of SCaC survey agency and here.\nData from Wave 8 of the SHARE project are available for download Data from all countries participating in the 8th wave of the SHARE-ERIC project, including data from the special SHARE Covid-19 questionnaire, are available for download at https://share-eric.eu/data/data-access, with full documentation https://share-eric.eu/data/data-documentation, and other information at https://share-eric.eu/ and http://share.cerge-ei.cz/. Data are in open access in STATA and SPSS formats, with data from national dropoff questionnaire (dropoff, module sharew8_rel1-0-0_dropoff) put together by external researchers cooperating with SHARE-CZ. Special questionnaire Covid-CZ collected during the second wave of the pandemic in fall 2020 only in the Czech Republic is in the module sharew8_rel1-0-0_xc.\nCollection of the Covid-19 CATI Survey Has Started A second interview on the Covid-19 epidemic in all SHARE-ERIC countries has started. We would like to ask all respondents for cooperation. In the Czech Republic, it is already a third CATI interview on Covid-19. The collected data will allow researchers to compare the consequences of the epidemic over time, to understand changes in behavior and to evaluate the effectiveness of government policies. More information is on the SCAC survey agencies website.\nOffer for placing research questions in the SHARE Wave 9 questionnaire in the Czech Republic As in previous waves of the SHARE project, we offer all researchers, and especially students, the opportunity to place their own questions in the drop-off questionnaire in Wave 9 in the Czech Republic. With your help, we will be preparing the next dropoff questionnaire in May and June 2021. All information and contacts can be found here.\nInterviewers’ Training for the Spring CATI Telephone Interview about Covid-19 The second special telephone interview (CATI) on Covid-19 epidemic will start in May and June 2021. The interviewers’ training has already started in March and April.\nWave 9 Scheduled for Fall 2021 The 9th wave of SHARE-ERIC will be collected in late fall 2021 and will end in spring 2022. We hope that the interview will be conducted as the usual face-to-face (CAPI) interview.\nSpecial Wave 8 Covid-19 Data Release Data from special CATI interviews collected in June-August 2020 are released in an open-access regime at https://share-eric.eu/. The SHARE Wave 8 COVID-19 data allow examining in-depth how the risk group of the older individuals is coping with the health-related and socioeconomic impact of COVID-19. The great advantage of these data is the possibility to measure and interpret differences in a cross-country and a longitudinal dimension. The European Commission supports our COVID-19 research project (SHARE-COVID19) with funds provided by Horizon 2020 and the Coronavirus Global Response.\nWave 9 will include Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocol (HCAP) study As one of six countries of SHARE project, the Czech Republic will participate in the Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocol (HCAP) study in Wave 9 in 2021-22. This study consists of a supplemental in-home 1-hour battery of cognitive tests to about 500 respondents aged 65+ and a 20-minute informant interview for the identification of early onset of cognitive impairment, dementia and the Alzheimer disease. Data will be linked to the main longitudinal SHARE data and will provide an unprecedented opportunity to better understand trends in the incidence and prevalence of dementia in Europe. The HCAP has been already collected in the Health and Retirement Study (USA) and the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing.\nData collection of the 8th wave successfully completed On Monday, December 14, 2020, the SCaC survey agency has successfully completed the second Covid19 telephone interview in the Czech Republic. We are grateful to all respondents for their participation. The data will released jointly with the main SHARE data release in 2020.\nSHARE continues its Wave 8 fieldwork with a second telephone interview on Covid19. The SHARE project in the Czech Republic will collect its second Covid19 telephone interview between October and December 2020. The questionnaire will be based on the first telephone interview from June and July. These special questionnaires will allow researchers to analyze the consequences of the first and second waves of the epidemics in the Czech Republic and Europe. The data will be important inputs into epidemiological models and we hope that in this way we will contribute to slow down the spread of the virus and minimize its negative consequences.More information can be found at the SCaC survey agency and at www.share-project.org.\nSHARE resumes Wave 8 fieldwork via telephone interviews including a special questionnaire The data collection will start at the beginning of June in a sub-sample of all SHARE panel respondents in 27 European countries and Israel.The data collected with this questionnaire will allow examining in depth how the risk group of the older individuals is coping with the health-related and socioeconomic impact of COVID-19. The great advantage of these data will be the possibility to measure and interpret differences in a cross-country and a longitudinal dimension. SHARE participation in a worldwide network of harmonized ageing surveys, permits European and even worldwide comparisons of how well the healthcare and social systems have responded to the pandemic and which lessons should be drawn for the future. Moreover, the use of data from previous waves allows comparing this crisis’ socioeconomic impact with previous hardships, for example the economic crisis in 2008.\nHence, the new SHARE data will enable researchers and policy makers to learn from the crisis management in other countries, linking these new data with what we already know about the life histories of our respondents and thus shed light on whether the already vulnerable have been particularly hit by the crisis, be it health-wise or economically. More information can be found at the SCaC survey agency and at www.share-project.org.\nData collection in Wave 8 temporarily stopped due to the coronavirus Based on communication with the main coordinator of the SHARE-ERIC project, the data collection of the 8th wave of the SHARE project in the Czech Republic is temporarily stopped as of Wednesday, March 11. There is not a single case of an interviewer or a respondent having symptoms of the disease, it is only a precautionary measure due to our 50+ respondent sample. The fieldwork will be resumed when the health situation permits. We will contact and inform interviewers and respondents together with the SCaC survey agency.\nWe are collecting data in Wave 8 Since October 2019, data collection of the 8th wave of the SHARE project (seventh wave in the Czech Republic) has been underway. Over 100 interviewers from the SCaC agency are collecting data from around 4,000 panel respondents all across the Czech Republic. We are also recruiting new households to bring the total number of respondents to 5,000. For more information on the course of the data collection and the contact protocol, see the website of the SCaC agency. We are really grateful to all respondents for cooperation and support of the project.\nData from the 7th wave of the SHARE project (release 7.0.0) for download Data from the 7th wave of data collection are available for download from the data server of the SHARE project at www.share-project.org. The data are in the STATA and SPSS format, also compatible with the R statistical software (free). Access to the data is on the main SHARE portal, where all the information on registration and data download can be found. The main portal also contains complete documentation, which is also available on the Czech website.\nField Rehearsal for 8th wave of data collection is underway In April and May 2019, we started the final field rehearsal of data collection and of the questionnaire and the CAPI computer system for the next wave of SHARE data collection in the Czech Republic. We hereby thank all the respondents for their participation and help. The 8th wave of data collection itself is planned for autumn 2019. Offer for the inclusion of questions in the paper-and-pencil questionnaire in the 8th wave of SHARE data collection Like in all data collection waves, researchers at Czech academic and scientific workplaces are offered the opportunity to include their own questions in the paper-and-pencil SHARE questionnaire. The so-called dropoff is a national questionnaire answered by respondents after their completion of the main questionnaire. The questions in the dropoff should be aimed at topics important for the Czech Republic that are not covered by the international questionnaire. We are happy to provide this service to Czech researchers free of charge and hope that the offer will lead to the analysis of new topics and formulation of data-based domestic policies. Those interested will find more information here.\nTesting of data collection for 8th wave of the SHARE project is underway In July and August 2018, thorough testing is being conducted of the questionnaire and the CAPI computer system for another wave of SHARE data collection in the Czech Republic. We hereby thank all the respondents for their participation and help. The second, final test will take place in June. The 8th wave of data collection itself is planned for January through June 2019. Data SHARE and easySHARE (release 6.1.1) for download The new easySHARE data release for incipient researchers and students is available on the SHARE data portal in a format for the programs STATA, SPSS, and R (free). To use the data, users must register (more information here).\nData collection of the 7th wave of the SHARE project in the Czech Republic has ended In October 2017, data collection of the 7th wave of the SHARE project (6th wave in the Czech Republic) came to an end. We thank all the respondents and interviewers for help and cooperation. Data from the 7th wave will be available for download in early 2019. IDEA for the 2017 election in cooperation with the SHARE-CZ project: Analysis of the incomes of the elderly Thanks to a new grant of the SHARE-CZ project, long-term cooperation is starting between the IDEA think-tank at CERGE UK and the scientific team of the SHARE project. The first result is the analysis of the incomes of the elderly by Filip Pertold and on the website of the IDEA project.\nData collection of the 7th wave of the SHARE project currently underway Since March 2017, data collection of the 7th wave of the SHARE project (6th wave in the Czech Republic) has been underway. Over 100 interviewers from the SCaC agency are collecting data from more than 4,500 respondents all across the Czech Republic. The interviewers are contacting respondents who participated in the data collection in the previous waves. For more information on the course of the data collection and the contact protocol, see the website of the SCaC agency. We thank all the respondents for cooperation and support of the project. The data collection will continue until September 2017.\nData from the 6th wave of the SHARE project (release 6.0.0) for download Data from the 6th wave of data collection are available for download from the data server of the SHARE project.

We hereby thank all the respondents for their participation and help. The second, final test will take place in June. The 7th wave of data collection itself is planned for January through June 2017. Preparations made for the 7th wave of data collection of the SHARE project aimed at life history The 7th wave of the collection of panel dates (sixth in the Czech Republic) will take place in January through June 2017 on a sample of our existing panel respondents. This wave will be aimed at life history – i.e. information on important events in the lives of individuals in their childhood, adolescence and adulthood, which will make it possible to monitor their later impacts in old age, especially on health, quality of life and socio-economic situation. Because a survey of life history already took place in the third wave in 2008, the respondents who already answered these questions will complete the usual questionnaire. We again expect the participation of external researches in formulating questions for the national paper-and-pencil questionnaire.",

    "content": "Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocol The project administers in-depth measurement of cognition according to the Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocol (HCAP) that has been developed for the HRS-style aging surveys supported by NIA. Using these data, the project will estimate prevalence rates of mild and severe cognitive impairment in the SHARE countries; compare these with HRS and other participants in the HCAP studies; and exploit the international variation of the SHARE plus SHARE-HCAP data in order to identify which interactions of biomedical and socioeconomic conditions over the life course affect cognition later in life.\nThe general aim of SHARE-HCAP is to exploit the international variation of health and life circumstances in Continental Europe to identify which interactions of bio-medical and socio-economic conditions over the life course affect cognition in later life. The understanding of such life-course pathways to first mild cognitive impairment and then, possibly, dementia, should help in developing preventive early interventions.\nThe project will enhance our understanding how the vastly differing social, health and long-term care systems affect mental health and resulting mortality of the aging populations. This holds especially for the life circumstances in Europe since World War II which are likely to have influenced cognitive decline now at older ages. Moreover, the large variation in key policy variables, e.g. retirement age, identifies pathways from early retirement through inactivity and loss of social contacts to lower cognition, mediated by education, working environment and other socio-economic factors over the life-course.\nMethodology:\nThe project will administer in-depth measurement of cognition according to the Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocol (HCAP) that has been developed for the HRS-style ageing surveys. HCAP consists of a recently developed battery of in-depth cognition measures. More specifically, it consists of about one hour of subject cognitive testing and a twenty-minute informant interview, both of which can be administered in the home or care facilities by survey interviewers with advanced training.\nThe measures included in HCAP were selected by three criteria: (a) can be administered in the home by a survey interviewer in about one hour, (b) can be administered comparably and lead to comparably valid assessments in other countries where HRS-type surveys are conducted, and (c) has sufficient overlap with the 2002/03 HRS-ADAMS study that it can be used to establish trends in the prevalence of cognitive impairment in the US. Using these data, the project will estimate prevalence rates of mild and severe cognitive impairment in the SHARE countries; compare these with HRS and other participants in the HCAP studies; and exploit the international variation of the SHARE plus SHARE-HCAP data in order to identify which interactions of biomedical and socioeconomic conditions over the life course affect cognition later in life.\nCountries: The project will be implemented in five SHARE countries (Denmark, Czech Republic, Germany, France, Italy) in a stratified study sample of 2,500 SHARE panel respondents. The start of the fieldwork is planned by early 2022. Versions of HCAP will also be conducted in the US, Mexico, India, China, and South Africa.\nFor more information on the HCAP Network visit: https://hcap.isr.umich.edu.\nCollection of SHARE-HCAP data in Wave 9 in the Czech Republic",

    "content": "National Self-Completion Questionnaire (Drop-off) in the 9th Wave of Data Collection The SHARE project is fully harmonized with similar studies in the U.S. (HRS), the UK (ELSA), and new initiatives in China, Japan, India, and other countries. As part of the main questionnaire, each country also includes a national self-completion questionnaire, the so-called drop-off, which allows countries to include their own questions. These do not have to be harmonized with other countries and offer a unique opportunity to address locally relevant issues or carry out field experiments that may not be meaningful in other contexts.\nThanks to the support of the Czech Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports and cooperation with the Research Institute for Labour and Social Affairs (RILSA), we have now been able to implement the drop-off questionnaire in the Czech Republic for the eighth time. In recent waves, we have opened the opportunity for external researchers in the Czech Republic to contribute their own questions.\nInvitation to Submit Your Questions for the National Drop-off Questionnaire We invite you to participate in the upcoming 9th wave of the SHARE project. The drop-off questionnaire is completed by respondents (or their proxies) after finishing the main CAPI interview. Due to space limitations, questions must be clearly worded, easy to understand (especially considering the age of the respondents), and should not deter participation. Importantly, they must not duplicate questions from the main questionnaire.\nResponses must be either numeric or selected from predefined categories—open-ended questions are not allowed. The drop-off will be pretested in autumn 2021 during the main questionnaire pilot. We will analyze responses from the test, remove problematic or non-informative questions, and prepare the final version of the drop-off, which must be approved by the project coordinator.\nData collected from the drop-off will be linked to the main longitudinal SHARE dataset, allowing researchers to relate responses to the respondents’ life histories and other data.\nIf you are interested in including your own questions in the SHARE drop-off, please contact us at the email addresses below. Before submitting your proposal, we encourage you to review questionnaires from previous waves (note that not all questions were successful) to avoid duplication. You can find these questionnaires—including coverscreen, main interviews, exit interviews, and previous drop-offs—at http://share.cerge-ei.cz.\nTo formulate your questions appropriately, we recommend registering for access to the SHARE dataset at https://share-eric.eu/, downloading the data free of charge, and exploring what variables which are already available. The website also contains full project documentation, including publications, methodological materials, and detailed codebooks.\nWe anticipate high interest, and each contributor will likely be allocated space for a small number of questions (i.e. a topic-specific module). Questions from all fields—sociology, psychology and economics are welcome. We particularly encourage contributions that address important issues in the Czech Republic, with potential for use in academic publications, dissertations, teaching, or evidence-based policymaking.\nWe are especially interested in questions that are comparable with other international studies. In addition to the usual longitudinal focus, the upcoming wave will also examine cognitive abilities and — in several countries including the Czech Republic — use accelerometers to measure participants’ physical activity.\nThis opportunity, like data access, is provided free of charge as part of the Czech SHARE infrastructure funded by the Czech government and Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports. Please note that questions must not be related to or funded by commercial entities. Violating this rule would not only be unethical, but could also jeopardize the SHARE project as a whole.\nWhile the primary selection criteria are quality and originality, this call is especially intended to support early-career researchers and students who may not otherwise have the opportunity to collect their own data.\nBefore each new wave, we contact all users and organize a workshop for those interested in submitting questions to the drop-off. If you’re interested, please send us your proposed topic, draft questions, and a short description or justification of your research idea. During the workshop, we will discuss all submissions and refine selected proposals into a working version to be submitted for approval and pilot testing.\nIf you know of a colleague who might be interested in participating, feel free to forward this call to them. We especially encourage forwarding this opportunity to your students.\nWe look forward to your participation and future collaboration.\nRadim Boháček\nSHARE National Coordinator – Czech Republic\nCERGE-EI\nPolitických vězňů 7\nPrague 1, 111 21\nPhone: +420 775 379 336\nEmail: radim.bohacek@cerge-ei.cz or radim.bohacek@gmail.com\nProject websites: https://share-eric.eu/ and http://share.cerge-ei.cz\nYou can find questionnaires and codebooks from previous waves here.",
    "description": "National Self-Completion Questionnaire (Drop-off) in the 9th Wave of Data Collection The SHARE project is fully harmonized with similar studies in the U.S. (HRS), the UK (ELSA), and new initiatives in China, Japan, India, and other countries. As part of the main questionnaire, each country also includes a national self-completion questionnaire, the so-called drop-off, which allows countries to include their own questions. These do not have to be harmonized with other countries and offer a unique opportunity to address locally relevant issues or carry out field experiments that may not be meaningful in other contexts.",

The first survey was collected in June-August 2020, the second CATI was collected in summer 2021.\nIn addition, the Czech Republic added an additional CATI-CZ Covid19 survey in October-December 2020.\nAll three surveys have a panel structure with repeated questions to capture changes in our respondents lives during the pandemic. All CATI Covid19 data have been linked to main longitudinal SHARE data.\nCATI1, CATI-CZ and CATI2 data have been already released.\nMore details can be found at SHARE-Covid19 website.\nUnderstanding non-intended consequences of epidemic control decisions to contain the pandemic The non-intended consequences of the epidemic control decisions to contain the COVID-19 pandemic are huge and affect the well-being of European citizens in terms of economics, social relationships and health: Europe is experiencing the largest recession since World War II, social contacts have been interrupted and people avoid seeking medical treatment in fear of infection.\nThe overarching objective of the SHARE-Covid19 project is to understand these non-intended consequences and to devise improved health, economic and social policies. In our policy recommendations, we strive to make healthcare systems and societies in the European Union more resilient to pandemics in terms of prevention, protection and treatment of the population 50+, who represent the most vulnerable segment of the population.\nThe project aims to identify healthcare inequalities before, during and after the pandemic, to understand the lockdown effects on health and health behaviours, to analyse labour market implications of the lockdown, to assess the impacts of pandemic and lockdown on income and wealth inequality, to mitigate the effects of epidemic control decisions on social relationships and to optimise future epidemic control measures by taking the geographical patterns of the disease and their relationship with social patterns into account as well as to better manage housing and living arrangements choices between independence, co-residence or institutionalisation.\nThe project pursues a transdisciplinary and internationally comparative approach by exploiting the data sources of the SHARE research infrastructure. It covers all EU Member States. The Max Planck Society is in charge of the project coordination. The project started on 1 November 2020 and will end on 30 October 2023",

More information on the project can be found on their website.\nAbout the SHARE Project SHARE-CZ is a Czech national node of the pan-European distributed research infrastructure SHARE-ERIC (Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe), which is a multidisciplinary and cross‑national longitudinal database of micro-data on health, socio-economic status, social and family networks and other issues collected from more than 140,000 individuals coming from 28 European countries and Israel aged 50+ and their partners. The result is a free and unique data collection that provides information about the state, history and the future of the Czech and European society. SHARE allows researchers and state administrations to understand the consequences of demographic changes and formulate optimal policies for public finances, labor market, health care or pension systems. Since 2004, SHARE is a longitudinal survey that is repeated every two years. The main goals are to create a main questionnaire for 5,000 respondents aged 50+ and their partners in each country, every two years collect data on the same individuals and store the collected data and its documentation in a user friendly, free and open access database accessible to all users. In 2019 and 2020 data of the 8th wave of the SHARE project in the Czech Republic have been collected, together with a special Covid19 CATI interview in spring and fall 2020.\nSHARE combines three unique and innovative strengths. It is ex-ante harmonized across the countries, multi-disciplinary and longitudinal. SHARE also provides publications on the methodology and data and organizes every year international conferences, workshops, user conferences and summer schools at the central level of the SHARE ERIC coordinator and at each SHARE national node. In the Czech Republic, SHARE-CZ cooperates with the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, Expert Commission on the Pension Reform of the Government of the Czech Republic and with more than 20 other universities and research organizations.\nFuture development\nResearchers participating in the SHARE-CZ project are actively cooperating with the world leading research projects on population ageing such as HRS (Health and Retirement Study), ELSA (English Longitudinal Study of Ageing), RAND Center for the Study of Aging and with the international research community in order to maintain highest possible quality of research, comparability of data with other surveys, methodology and innovative technology of data collection and dissemination. Future development of SHARE-CZ includes the collection of biomarkers, linkage of data to official statistics, development of new modules (time use questionnaire, cognitive functions, life history), user friendly easySHARE database for students, national questionnaires developed by external researchers, new modes of interviewing between the main waves of data collection, evaluation and development of physical and mental health measures, a pension claim data base and European Poverty Module, among others.\nSocio-economic impact\nSHARE-CZ research infrastructure is a service for the international and Czech research community as well as to the whole society. SHARE-CZ promotes innovation and research through its freely accessible data used by other researchers at universities and other research organizations. In spring 2021, the SHARE-ERIC research infrastructure had over 12,000 registered individual users and more than 3,100 scientific publications. The main impact of SHARE is the creation of a truly longitudinal and internationally comparable data collection, which allows researchers to analyse and understand interactions between the dramatically changing demographic development and policy responses in individual countries and the EU as a whole.\nRadim Boháček, PhD\nCountry team leader in the Czech Republic\nEconomics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences",
