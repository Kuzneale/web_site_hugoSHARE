<h3 id="share-in-the-czech-republic">SHARE in the Czech Republic</h3>
<p>Welcome to the official website of the SHARE project in the Czech Republic.  SHARE is a multi-disciplinary international time-collection database of microdata on health, socioeconomic status and social and family networks of approximately 150,000 individuals (over 530,000 interviews) aged 50+ from all EU countries, Switzerland and Israel.</p>
<p>All information on the project can be found at its official website at <a href="https://share-eric.eu/" rel="external" target="_self">https://share-eric.eu/</a>.</p>
<p>This English language website has its mirror website in <a href="http://share.cerge-ei.cz/index.htm" rel="external" target="_self">Czech</a> language.</p>
<p>The data collection is carried out by the <a href="http://scac.cz/" rel="external" target="_self">SCaC</a> agency. More information on the project can be found on their website.</p>
<h3 id="about-the-share-project">About the SHARE Project</h3>
<p>SHARE-CZ is a Czech national node of the pan-European distributed research infrastructure SHARE-ERIC (Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe), which is a multidisciplinary and cross‑national longitudinal database of micro-data on health, socio-economic status, social and family networks and other issues collected from more than 140,000 individuals coming from 28 European countries and Israel aged 50+ and their partners. The result is a free and unique data collection that provides information about the state, history and the future of the Czech and European society. SHARE allows researchers and state administrations to understand the consequences of demographic changes and formulate optimal policies for public finances, labor market, health care or pension systems. Since 2004, SHARE is a longitudinal survey that is repeated every two years. The main goals are to create a main questionnaire for 5,000 respondents aged 50+ and their partners in each country, every two years collect data on the same individuals and store the collected data and its documentation in a user friendly, free and open access database accessible to all users. In 2019 and 2020 data of the 8th wave of the SHARE project in the Czech Republic have been collected, together with a special Covid19 CATI interview in spring and fall 2020.</p>
<p>SHARE combines three unique and innovative strengths. It is ex-ante harmonized across the countries, multi-disciplinary and longitudinal. SHARE also provides publications on the methodology and data and organizes every year international conferences, workshops, user conferences and summer schools at the central level of the SHARE ERIC coordinator and at each SHARE national node. In the Czech Republic, SHARE-CZ cooperates with the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, Expert Commission on the Pension Reform of the Government of the Czech Republic and with more than 20 other universities and research organizations.</p>
<p>Future development</p>
<p>Researchers participating in the SHARE-CZ project are actively cooperating with the world leading research projects on population ageing such as HRS (Health and Retirement Study), ELSA (English Longitudinal Study of Ageing), RAND Center for the Study of Aging and with the international research community in order to maintain highest possible quality of research, comparability of data with other surveys, methodology and innovative technology of data collection and dissemination. Future development of SHARE-CZ includes the collection of biomarkers, linkage of data to official statistics, development of new modules (time use questionnaire, cognitive functions, life history), user friendly easySHARE database for students, national questionnaires developed by external researchers, new modes of interviewing between the main waves of data collection, evaluation and development of physical and mental health measures, a pension claim data base and European Poverty Module, among others.</p>
<p>Socio-economic impact</p>
<p>SHARE-CZ research infrastructure is a service for the international and Czech research community as well as to the whole society. SHARE-CZ promotes innovation and research through its freely accessible data used by other researchers at universities and other research organizations.  In spring 2021, the SHARE-ERIC research infrastructure had over 12,000 registered individual users and more than 3,100 scientific publications. The main impact of SHARE is the creation of a truly longitudinal and internationally comparable data collection, which allows researchers to analyse and understand interactions between the dramatically changing demographic development and policy responses in individual countries and the EU as a whole.</p>

<p>The 10th wave of SHARE-ERIC data collection has begun in October and will continue till March 2025. In Wave 10 contains an innovative project neuroSHARE focusing on early detection of Parkinson and Alzheimer diseases. The neuroSHARE project is prepared in cooperation with researchers from the First Faculty of Medicine at the Charles University and the Czech Technical University. The project consists of a speech, sleep and smell tests collected immediately after the main interview.  We are very thankful to all respondents and interviewers for their cooperation. More information can be found at websites of <a href="https://scac.cz/share/" rel="external" target="_self">SCaC</a> survey agency.</p>
<h3 id="neuroshare-project-in-wave-10-of-the-share-project">neuroSHARE Project in Wave 10 of the SHARE project</h3>
<p>In the 10th wave of the SHARE project in the Czech Republic we introduce a collection of neuromarkers consisting of three tests: a test of smell, speech and a questionnaire on REM sleep quality in cooperation with the 1st Medical Faculty of Charles University and the Czech Technical University in Prague. For the first time, these tests will be fielded on a large population sample. The goal of the project is early detection of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson and Alzheimer diseases as well as depression, their timely detection and treatment. We are planning even more extensive collection of objective data, so-called biomarkers in Wave 11. This project will be carried out in collaboration with the large RECETOX research infrastructure at Masaryk University in Brno.</p>

<p>Data from special CATI interviews collected in June-August 2020 are released in an open-access regime at <a href="https://share-eric.eu/" rel="external" target="_self">https://share-eric.eu/</a>. The SHARE Wave 8 COVID-19 data allow examining in-depth how the risk group of the older individuals is coping with the health-related and socioeconomic impact of COVID-19. The great advantage of these data is the possibility to measure and interpret differences in a cross-country and a longitudinal dimension. The European Commission supports our COVID-19 research project (SHARE-COVID19) with funds provided by Horizon 2020 and the Coronavirus Global Response.</p>
<h3 id="wave-9-will-include-harmonized-cognitive-assessment-protocol-hcap-study">Wave 9 will include Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocol (HCAP) study</h3>
<p>As one of six countries of SHARE project, the Czech Republic will participate in the Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocol (HCAP) study in Wave 9 in 2021-22. This study consists of a supplemental in-home 1-hour battery of cognitive tests to about 500 respondents aged 65+ and a 20-minute informant interview for the identification of early onset of cognitive impairment, dementia and the Alzheimer disease. Data will be linked to the main longitudinal SHARE data and will provide an unprecedented opportunity to better understand trends in the incidence and prevalence of dementia in Europe. The HCAP has been already collected in the Health and Retirement Study (USA) and the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing.</p>
<h3 id="data-collection-of-the-8th-wave-successfully-completed">Data collection of the 8th wave successfully completed</h3>
<p>On Monday, December 14, 2020, the SCaC survey agency has successfully completed the second Covid19 telephone interview in the Czech Republic. We are grateful to all respondents for their participation. The data will released jointly with the main SHARE data release in 2020.</p>
<h3 id="share-continues-its-wave-8-fieldwork-with-a-second-telephone-interview-on-covid19">SHARE continues its Wave 8 fieldwork with a second telephone interview on Covid19.</h3>
<p>The SHARE project in the Czech Republic will collect its second Covid19 telephone interview between October and December 2020. The questionnaire will be based on the first telephone interview from June and July. These special questionnaires will allow researchers to analyze the consequences of the first and second waves of the epidemics in the Czech Republic and Europe. The data will be important inputs into epidemiological models and we hope that in this way we will contribute to slow down the spread of the virus and minimize its negative consequences.<p>More information can be found at the <a href="http://scac.cz/">SCaC</a> survey agency and at <a href="http://www.share-project.org/"><a href="https://www.share-project.org" rel="external" target="_self">www.share-project.org</a></a>.</p></p>
<h3 id="share-resumes-wave-8-fieldwork-via-telephone-interviews-including-a-special-questionnaire">SHARE resumes Wave 8 fieldwork via telephone interviews including a special questionnaire</h3>
<p>The data collection will start at the beginning of June in a sub-sample of all SHARE panel respondents in 27 European countries and Israel.<p>The data collected with this questionnaire will allow examining in depth how the risk group of the older individuals is coping with the health-related and socioeconomic impact of COVID-19. The great advantage of these data will be the possibility to measure and interpret differences in a cross-country and a longitudinal dimension. SHARE participation in a worldwide network of harmonized ageing surveys, permits European and even worldwide comparisons of how well the healthcare and social systems have responded to the pandemic and which lessons should be drawn for the future. Moreover, the use of data from previous waves allows comparing this crisis&rsquo; socioeconomic impact with previous hardships, for example the economic crisis in 2008.</p><p>Hence, the new SHARE data will enable researchers and policy makers to learn from the crisis management in other countries, linking these new data with what we already know about the life histories of our respondents and thus shed light on whether the already vulnerable have been particularly hit by the crisis, be it health-wise or economically.

<p>The 7th wave of the collection of panel dates (sixth in the Czech Republic) will take place in January through June 2017 on a sample of our existing panel respondents. This wave will be aimed at life history – i.e. information on important events in the lives of individuals in their childhood, adolescence and adulthood, which will make it possible to monitor their later impacts in old age, especially on health, quality of life and socio-economic situation. Because a survey of life history already took place in the third wave in 2008, the respondents who already answered these questions will complete the usual questionnaire. We again expect the participation of external researches in formulating questions for the national paper-and-pencil questionnaire.</p>

<h1 id="hcap-cognition-data">HCAP cognition data</h1>

<h2 id="harmonized-cognitive-assessment-protocol">Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocol</h2>
<p>The project administers in-depth measurement of cognition according to the Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocol (HCAP) that has been developed for the HRS-style aging surveys supported by NIA. Using these data, the project will estimate prevalence rates of mild and severe cognitive impairment in the SHARE countries; compare these with HRS and other participants in the HCAP studies; and exploit the international variation of the SHARE plus SHARE-HCAP data in order to identify which interactions of biomedical and socioeconomic conditions over the life course affect cognition later in life.</p>
<p>The general aim of SHARE-HCAP is to exploit the international variation of health and life circumstances in Continental Europe to identify which interactions of bio-medical and socio-economic conditions over the life course affect cognition in later life. The understanding of such life-course pathways to first mild cognitive impairment and then, possibly, dementia, should help in developing preventive early interventions.</p>
<p>The project will enhance our understanding how the vastly differing social, health and long-term care systems affect mental health and resulting mortality of the aging populations. This holds especially for the life circumstances in Europe since World War II which are likely to have influenced cognitive decline now at older ages. Moreover, the large variation in key policy variables, e.g. retirement age, identifies pathways from early retirement through inactivity and loss of social contacts to lower cognition, mediated by education, working environment and other socio-economic factors over the life-course.</p>
<p>Methodology:</p>
<p>The project will administer in-depth measurement of cognition according to the Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocol (HCAP) that has been developed for the HRS-style ageing surveys. HCAP consists of a recently developed battery of in-depth cognition measures. More specifically, it consists of about one hour of subject cognitive testing and a twenty-minute informant interview, both of which can be administered in the home or care facilities by survey interviewers with advanced training.</p>
<p>The measures included in HCAP were selected by three criteria: (a) can be administered in the home by a survey interviewer in about one hour, (b) can be administered comparably and lead to comparably valid assessments in other countries where HRS-type surveys are conducted, and (c) has sufficient overlap with the 2002/03 HRS-ADAMS study that it can be used to establish trends in the prevalence of cognitive impairment in the US. Using these data, the project will estimate prevalence rates of mild and severe cognitive impairment in the SHARE countries; compare these with HRS and other participants in the HCAP studies; and exploit the international variation of the SHARE plus SHARE-HCAP data in order to identify which interactions of biomedical and socioeconomic conditions over the life course affect cognition later in life.</p>
<p>Countries: The project will be implemented in five SHARE countries (Denmark, Czech Republic, Germany, France, Italy) in a stratified study sample of 2,500 SHARE panel respondents. The start of the fieldwork is planned by early 2022. Versions of HCAP will also be conducted in the US, Mexico, India, China, and South Africa.</p>

<h2 id="national-self-completion-questionnaire-drop-off-in-the-9th-wave-of-data-collection">National Self-Completion Questionnaire (Drop-off) in the 9th Wave of Data Collection</h2>
<p>The SHARE project is fully harmonized with similar studies in the U.S. (HRS), the UK (ELSA), and new initiatives in China, Japan, India, and other countries. As part of the main questionnaire, each country also includes a national self-completion questionnaire, the so-called <em>drop-off</em>, which allows countries to include their own questions. These do not have to be harmonized with other countries and offer a unique opportunity to address locally relevant issues or carry out field experiments that may not be meaningful in other contexts.</p>
<p>Thanks to the support of the Czech Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports and cooperation with the Research Institute for Labour and Social Affairs (RILSA), we have now been able to implement the drop-off questionnaire in the Czech Republic for the eighth time. In recent waves, we have opened the opportunity for external researchers in the Czech Republic to contribute their own questions.</p>
<h2 id="invitation-to-submit-your-questions-for-the-national-drop-off-questionnaire">Invitation to Submit Your Questions for the National Drop-off Questionnaire</h2>
<p>We invite you to participate in the upcoming 9th wave of the SHARE project. The drop-off questionnaire is completed by respondents (or their proxies) after finishing the main CAPI interview. Due to space limitations, questions must be clearly worded, easy to understand (especially considering the age of the respondents), and should not deter participation. Importantly, they must not duplicate questions from the main questionnaire.</p>
<p>Responses must be either numeric or selected from predefined categories—open-ended questions are not allowed. The drop-off will be pretested in autumn 2021 during the main questionnaire pilot. We will analyze responses from the test, remove problematic or non-informative questions, and prepare the final version of the drop-off, which must be approved by the project coordinator.</p>
<p>Data collected from the drop-off will be linked to the main longitudinal SHARE dataset, allowing researchers to relate responses to the respondents’ life histories and other data.</p>
<p>If you are interested in including your own questions in the SHARE drop-off, please contact us at the email addresses below. Before submitting your proposal, we encourage you to review questionnaires from previous waves (note that not all questions were successful) to avoid duplication. You can find these questionnaires—including coverscreen, main interviews, exit interviews, and previous drop-offs—at <a href="http://share.cerge-ei.cz/" rel="external" target="_self">http://share.cerge-ei.cz</a>.</p>
<p>To formulate your questions appropriately, we recommend registering for access to the SHARE dataset at <a href="https://share-eric.eu/" rel="external" target="_self">https://share-eric.eu/</a>, downloading the data free of charge, and exploring what variables which are already available. The website also contains full project documentation, including publications, methodological materials, and detailed codebooks.</p>
<p>We anticipate high interest, and each contributor will likely be allocated space for a small number of questions (i.e. a topic-specific module). Questions from all fields—sociology, psychology and economics are welcome. We particularly encourage contributions that address important issues in the Czech Republic, with potential for use in academic publications, dissertations, teaching, or evidence-based policymaking.</p>
<p>We are especially interested in questions that are comparable with other international studies. In addition to the usual longitudinal focus, the upcoming wave will also examine cognitive abilities and — in several countries including the Czech Republic — use accelerometers to measure participants’ physical activity.</p>
<p>This opportunity, like data access, is provided free of charge as part of the Czech SHARE infrastructure funded by the Czech government and Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports. Please note that questions must not be related to or funded by commercial entities. Violating this rule would not only be unethical, but could also jeopardize the SHARE project as a whole.</p>
<p>While the primary selection criteria are quality and originality, this call is especially intended to support early-career researchers and students who may not otherwise have the opportunity to collect their own data.</p>
<p>Before each new wave, we contact all users and organize a workshop for those interested in submitting questions to the drop-off. If you’re interested, please send us your proposed topic, draft questions, and a short description or justification of your research idea. During the workshop, we will discuss all submissions and refine selected proposals into a working version to be submitted for approval and pilot testing.</p>
<p>If you know of a colleague who might be interested in participating, feel free to forward this call to them. We especially encourage forwarding this opportunity to your students.</p>
<p>We look forward to your participation and future collaboration.</p>

<p>In SHARE Wave 8, data on physical activity were collected by using accelerometers. A subsample of the panel respondents were asked to wear the device (Axivity AX3) for eight consecutive days (day and night) on their upper thigh.</p>
<p>The SHARE accelerometer study was conducted in ten countries: Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden. A detailed description of the study is available in the SHARE Wave 8 Methodology Volume. Raw accelerometer data is processed with GGIR and resulting measures are available in the Wave 8 gv_accelerometer modules. Provided metrics include vector magnitude (ENMO), intensity gradient, and LXMX measures. Additional datasets provide information on acceleration on epoch level (5 seconds) for each participant.</p>

<h1 id="easyshare">easySHARE</h1>

<h2 id="easyshare-version-900"><em>easy</em>SHARE (version 9.0.0)</h2>
<p><em>easy</em>SHARE is a simplified version of the SHARE database, designed primarily for researchers and students who are just starting with the analysis of complex longitudinal data.<br>
While the main SHARE database is split into dozens of files by wave, <em>easy</em>SHARE compiles information on all respondents across all countries and waves into a single dataset.</p>
<p>The data structure is much more user-friendly – information on respondents and their households is merged across all waves. Missing values are clearly classified and the dataset includes many derived variables (e.g., education level according to ISCED, health index, functional limitations, demographic and economic indicators).</p>
<p><em>easy</em>SHARE is fully compatible with other ageing studies (such as HRS and ELSA) and supports <strong>group registration</strong> for university teaching purposes.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="data-structure">Data Structure</h3>
<p>The data are available as a single ZIP file containing information on respondents from all participating countries since 2004 (including the Czech Republic from 2006 onward). This format is ideal for teaching panel data analysis and for cross-country comparisons.</p>
<p>The archive also includes a Stata script used to create the <em>easy</em>SHARE file from the main database – allowing users to trace how the variables were derived and linked, and to adapt the code for their own research.</p>

<h2 id="epidemiological-model-abmshare">Epidemiological Model abmSHARE</h2>
<p>In collaboration with the Faculty of Biomedical Engineering at CTU and the company DNAi s.r.o., we have developed an <strong>agent-based epidemiological model</strong> called <strong>abmSHARE</strong>.</p>
<p>This model is able to use input data from both the <strong>SHARE</strong> project, <strong>Eurostat</strong>, or any external data, at the geographical level corresponding to <strong>NUTS2</strong> regions.</p>
<p>The goal of the model is to simulate the spread and impact of <strong>Covid-19</strong> and similar epidemiological scenarios.</p>

<h2 id="share-covid19-cati-project">SHARE-Covid19 CATI Project</h2>
<p>SHARE collected two special surveys on Covid19 both in CATI mode. The first survey was collected in June-August 2020, the second CATI was collected in summer 2021.</p>
<p>In addition, the Czech Republic added an additional CATI-CZ Covid19 survey in October-December 2020.</p>
<p>All three surveys have a panel structure with repeated questions to capture changes in our respondents lives during the pandemic. All CATI Covid19 data have been linked to main longitudinal SHARE data.</p>
<p>CATI1, CATI-CZ and CATI2 data have been already released.</p>

<h3 id="understanding-non-intended-consequences-of-epidemic-control-decisions-to-contain-the-pandemic">Understanding non-intended consequences of epidemic control decisions to contain the pandemic</h3>
<p>The non-intended consequences of the epidemic control decisions to contain the COVID-19 pandemic are huge and affect the well-being of European citizens in terms of economics, social relationships and health: Europe is experiencing the largest recession since World War II, social contacts have been interrupted and people avoid seeking medical treatment in fear of infection.</p>
<p>The overarching objective of the SHARE-Covid19 project is to understand these non-intended consequences and to devise improved health, economic and social policies. In our policy recommendations, we strive to make healthcare systems and societies in the European Union more resilient to pandemics in terms of prevention, protection and treatment of the population 50+, who represent the most vulnerable segment of the population.</p>
<p>The project aims to identify healthcare inequalities before, during and after the pandemic, to understand the lockdown effects on health and health behaviours, to analyse labour market implications of the lockdown, to assess the impacts of pandemic and lockdown on income and wealth inequality, to mitigate the effects of epidemic control decisions on social relationships and to optimise future epidemic control measures by taking the geographical patterns of the disease and their relationship with social patterns into account as well as to better manage housing and living arrangements choices between independence, co-residence or institutionalisation.</p>
<p>The project pursues a transdisciplinary and internationally comparative approach by exploiting the data sources of the SHARE research infrastructure. It covers all EU Member States. The Max Planck Society is in charge of the project coordination. The project started on 1 November 2020 and will end on 30 October 2023</p>

<h2 id="interactive-data-and-documentation-tool">Interactive Data and Documentation Tool<br></h2>
<p>The SHARE Data &amp; Documentation Tool is a web application developed by CentERdata (Institute for Data Collection and Research) in collaboration with SHARE Central at the Munich Center for the Economics of Aging (MEA). For researchers, the tool serves as a fast, customizable, and user-friendly web interface for browsing and searching the SHARE metadata.</p>
<p>One of the key features of the system is the ability to generate codebooks for all currently available waves and modules of the SHARE project in PDF format. This allows researchers to get an initial overview of the dataset’s content and case numbers without needing to download the data.</p>
<p>The <strong>&ldquo;Browse Publications&rdquo;</strong> tab includes all publications reported to SHARE Central, such as journal articles, books, book chapters, and other types of work like discussion papers or theses.</p>
<p>The <strong>&ldquo;Search&rdquo;</strong> function helps you quickly locate the information you need — whether across all areas, or specifically within datasets, questionnaires, or publications.</p>

<p>SHARE (Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe) is an international scientific study coordinated by the SHARE-ERIC consortium and national partners. In the Czech Republic, the study is implemented by the Czech Academy of Sciences (SHARE-CZ), and fieldwork is conducted by the Prague-based research agency SCaC. All procedures strictly comply with EU and Czech data protection laws.</p>
<p>The aim of SHARE is to gain a deeper understanding of the lives, health, and social and economic circumstances of individuals aged 50 and above. The collected data supports research and evidence-based policymaking. The Czech SHARE project is funded by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports and the European Commission.</p>
<p>Participants are randomly selected. Participation is entirely voluntary.</p>
<p>Your answers are anonymized — your name or address will never be connected to your responses. This also applies to follow-up interviews or interviews with relatives of deceased participants. All data is linked only by an anonymous code, not personal identifiers.</p>
<p><strong>No identifying information is ever shared with third parties.</strong></p>
