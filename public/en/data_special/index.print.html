<h2 id="national-self-completion-questionnaire-drop-off-in-the-9th-wave-of-data-collection"><big>National Self-Completion Questionnaire (Drop-off) in the 9th Wave of Data Collection<br></big></h2>
<p>The SHARE project is fully harmonized with similar studies in the U.S. (HRS), the UK (ELSA), and new initiatives in China, Japan, India, and other countries. As part of the main questionnaire, each country also includes a national self-completion questionnaire, the so-called <em>drop-off</em>, which allows countries to include their own questions. These do not have to be harmonized with other countries and offer a unique opportunity to address locally relevant issues or carry out field experiments that may not be meaningful in other contexts.</p>
<p>Thanks to the support of the Czech Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports and cooperation with the Research Institute for Labour and Social Affairs (RILSA), we have now been able to implement the drop-off questionnaire in the Czech Republic for the eighth time. In recent waves, we have opened the opportunity for external researchers in the Czech Republic to contribute their own questions.</p>
<h2 id="invitation-to-submit-your-questions-for-the-national-drop-off-questionnaire"><big>Invitation to Submit Your Questions for the National Drop-off Questionnaire</big></h2>
<p>We invite you to participate in the upcoming 9th wave of the SHARE project. The drop-off questionnaire is completed by respondents (or their proxies) after finishing the main CAPI interview. Due to space limitations, questions must be clearly worded, easy to understand (especially considering the age of the respondents), and should not deter participation. Importantly, they must not duplicate questions from the main questionnaire.</p>
<p>Responses must be either numeric or selected from predefined categories—open-ended questions are not allowed. The drop-off will be pretested in autumn 2021 during the main questionnaire pilot. We will analyze responses from the test, remove problematic or non-informative questions, and prepare the final version of the drop-off, which must be approved by the project coordinator.</p>
<p>Data collected from the drop-off will be linked to the main longitudinal SHARE dataset, allowing researchers to relate responses to the respondents’ life histories and other data.</p>
<p>If you are interested in including your own questions in the SHARE drop-off, please contact us at the email addresses below. Before submitting your proposal, we encourage you to review questionnaires from previous waves (note that not all questions were successful) to avoid duplication. You can find these questionnaires—including coverscreen, main interviews, exit interviews, and previous drop-offs—at <a href="http://share.cerge-ei.cz/" rel="external" target="_self">http://share.cerge-ei.cz</a>.</p>
<p>To formulate your questions appropriately, we recommend registering for access to the SHARE dataset at <a href="https://share-eric.eu/" rel="external" target="_self">https://share-eric.eu/</a>, downloading the data free of charge, and exploring what variables which are already available. The website also contains full project documentation, including publications, methodological materials, and detailed codebooks.</p>
<p>We anticipate high interest, and each contributor will likely be allocated space for a small number of questions (i.e. a topic-specific module). Questions from all fields—sociology, psychology and economics are welcome. We particularly encourage contributions that address important issues in the Czech Republic, with potential for use in academic publications, dissertations, teaching, or evidence-based policymaking.</p>
<p>We are especially interested in questions that are comparable with other international studies. In addition to the usual longitudinal focus, the upcoming wave will also examine cognitive abilities and — in several countries including the Czech Republic — use accelerometers to measure participants’ physical activity.</p>
<p>This opportunity, like data access, is provided free of charge as part of the Czech SHARE infrastructure funded by the Czech government and Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports. Please note that questions must not be related to or funded by commercial entities. Violating this rule would not only be unethical, but could also jeopardize the SHARE project as a whole.</p>
<p>While the primary selection criteria are quality and originality, this call is especially intended to support early-career researchers and students who may not otherwise have the opportunity to collect their own data.</p>
<p>Before each new wave, we contact all users and organize a workshop for those interested in submitting questions to the drop-off. If you’re interested, please send us your proposed topic, draft questions, and a short description or justification of your research idea. During the workshop, we will discuss all submissions and refine selected proposals into a working version to be submitted for approval and pilot testing.</p>
<p>If you know of a colleague who might be interested in participating, feel free to forward this call to them. We especially encourage forwarding this opportunity to your students.</p>
<p>We look forward to your participation and future collaboration.</p>

<h3 id="collection-of-share-hcap-data-in-wave-9-in-the-czech-republic">Collection of SHARE-HCAP data in Wave 9 in the Czech Republic</h3>
<h3 id="harmonized-cognitive-assessment-protocol">Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocol</h3>
<p>The project administers in-depth measurement of cognition according to the Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocol (HCAP) that has been developed for the HRS-style aging surveys supported by NIA. Using these data, the project will estimate prevalence rates of mild and severe cognitive impairment in the SHARE countries; compare these with HRS and other participants in the HCAP studies; and exploit the international variation of the SHARE plus SHARE-HCAP data in order to identify which interactions of biomedical and socioeconomic conditions over the life course affect cognition later in life.</p>
<p>The general aim of SHARE-HCAP is to exploit the international variation of health and life circumstances in Continental Europe to identify which interactions of bio-medical and socio-economic conditions over the life course affect cognition in later life. The understanding of such life-course pathways to first mild cognitive impairment and then, possibly, dementia, should help in developing preventive early interventions.</p>
<p>The project will enhance our understanding how the vastly differing social, health and long-term care systems affect mental health and resulting mortality of the aging populations. This holds especially for the life circumstances in Europe since World War II which are likely to have influenced cognitive decline now at older ages. Moreover, the large variation in key policy variables, e.g. retirement age, identifies pathways from early retirement through inactivity and loss of social contacts to lower cognition, mediated by education, working environment and other socio-economic factors over the life-course.</p>
<p>Methodology:</p>
<p>The project will administer in-depth measurement of cognition according to the Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocol (HCAP) that has been developed for the HRS-style ageing surveys. HCAP consists of a recently developed battery of in-depth cognition measures. More specifically, it consists of about one hour of subject cognitive testing and a twenty-minute informant interview, both of which can be administered in the home or care facilities by survey interviewers with advanced training.</p>
<p>The measures included in HCAP were selected by three criteria: (a) can be administered in the home by a survey interviewer in about one hour, (b) can be administered comparably and lead to comparably valid assessments in other countries where HRS-type surveys are conducted, and (c) has sufficient overlap with the 2002/03 HRS-ADAMS study that it can be used to establish trends in the prevalence of cognitive impairment in the US. Using these data, the project will estimate prevalence rates of mild and severe cognitive impairment in the SHARE countries; compare these with HRS and other participants in the HCAP studies; and exploit the international variation of the SHARE plus SHARE-HCAP data in order to identify which interactions of biomedical and socioeconomic conditions over the life course affect cognition later in life.</p>
<p>Countries: The project will be implemented in five SHARE countries (Denmark, Czech Republic, Germany, France, Italy) in a stratified study sample of 2,500 SHARE panel respondents. The start of the fieldwork is planned by early 2022. Versions of HCAP will also be conducted in the US, Mexico, India, China, and South Africa.</p>

<p>In SHARE Wave 8, data on physical activity were collected by using accelerometers. A subsample of the panel respondents were asked to wear the device (Axivity AX3) for eight consecutive days (day and night) on their upper thigh.</p>
<p>The SHARE accelerometer study was conducted in ten countries: Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden. A detailed description of the study is available in the SHARE Wave 8 Methodology Volume. Raw accelerometer data is processed with GGIR and resulting measures are available in the Wave 8 gv_accelerometer modules. Provided metrics include vector magnitude (ENMO), intensity gradient, and LXMX measures. Additional datasets provide information on acceleration on epoch level (5 seconds) for each participant.</p>

<h1 id="easyshare">easySHARE</h1>

<h3 id="easyshare-version-900"><em>easy</em>SHARE (version 9.0.0)<br></h3>
<p><em>easy</em>SHARE is a simplified version of the SHARE database, designed primarily for researchers and students who are just starting with the analysis of complex longitudinal data.<br>
While the main SHARE database is split into dozens of files by wave, <em>easy</em>SHARE compiles information on all respondents across all countries and waves into a single dataset.</p>
<p>The data structure is much more user-friendly – information on respondents and their households is merged across all waves. Missing values are clearly classified and the dataset includes many derived variables (e.g., education level according to ISCED, health index, functional limitations, demographic and economic indicators).</p>
<p><em>easy</em>SHARE is fully compatible with other ageing studies (such as HRS and ELSA) and supports <strong>group registration</strong> for university teaching purposes.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="data-structure">Data Structure</h3>
<p>The data are available as a single ZIP file containing information on respondents from all participating countries since 2004 (including the Czech Republic from 2006 onward). This format is ideal for teaching panel data analysis and for cross-country comparisons.</p>
<p>The archive also includes a Stata script used to create the <em>easy</em>SHARE file from the main database – allowing users to trace how the variables were derived and linked, and to adapt the code for their own research.</p>

<h1 id="epidemiological-model-abmshare">Epidemiological Model abmSHARE</h1>
<p>In collaboration with the Faculty of Biomedical Engineering at CTU and the company DNAi s.r.o., we are developing an <strong>agent-based epidemiological model</strong> called <strong>abmSHARE</strong>.</p>
<p>This model will be able to use input data from both the <strong>SHARE</strong> project and <strong>Eurostat</strong>, at the geographical level corresponding to <strong>NUTS2</strong> regions.</p>
<p>The goal of the model is to simulate the spread and impact of <strong>Covid-19</strong>, using data from the <strong>SPLASH</strong> database, which contains information on policy measures implemented during the pandemic.</p>

<h3 id="share-covid19-cati-project">SHARE-Covid19 CATI Project<br></h3>
<p>SHARE collected two special surveys on Covid19 both in CATI mode. The first survey was collected in June-August 2020, the second CATI was collected in summer 2021.</p>
<p>In addition, the Czech Republic added an additional CATI-CZ Covid19 survey in October-December 2020.</p>
<p>All three surveys have a panel structure with repeated questions to capture changes in our respondents lives during the pandemic. All CATI Covid19 data have been linked to main longitudinal SHARE data.</p>
<p>CATI1, CATI-CZ and CATI2 data have been already released.</p>

<h3 id="understanding-non-intended-consequences-of-epidemic-control-decisions-to-contain-the-pandemic">Understanding non-intended consequences of epidemic control decisions to contain the pandemic</h3>
<p>The non-intended consequences of the epidemic control decisions to contain the COVID-19 pandemic are huge and affect the well-being of European citizens in terms of economics, social relationships and health: Europe is experiencing the largest recession since World War II, social contacts have been interrupted and people avoid seeking medical treatment in fear of infection.</p>
<p>The overarching objective of the SHARE-Covid19 project is to understand these non-intended consequences and to devise improved health, economic and social policies. In our policy recommendations, we strive to make healthcare systems and societies in the European Union more resilient to pandemics in terms of prevention, protection and treatment of the population 50+, who represent the most vulnerable segment of the population.</p>
<p>The project aims to identify healthcare inequalities before, during and after the pandemic, to understand the lockdown effects on health and health behaviours, to analyse labour market implications of the lockdown, to assess the impacts of pandemic and lockdown on income and wealth inequality, to mitigate the effects of epidemic control decisions on social relationships and to optimise future epidemic control measures by taking the geographical patterns of the disease and their relationship with social patterns into account as well as to better manage housing and living arrangements choices between independence, co-residence or institutionalisation.</p>
<p>The project pursues a transdisciplinary and internationally comparative approach by exploiting the data sources of the SHARE research infrastructure. It covers all EU Member States. The Max Planck Society is in charge of the project coordination. The project started on 1 November 2020 and will end on 30 October 2023</p>

<h2 id="interactive-data-and-documentation-tool">Interactive Data and Documentation Tool<br></h2>
<p>The SHARE Data &amp; Documentation Tool is a web application developed by CentERdata (Institute for Data Collection and Research) in collaboration with SHARE Central at the Munich Center for the Economics of Aging (MEA). For researchers, the tool serves as a fast, customizable, and user-friendly web interface for browsing and searching the SHARE metadata.</p>
<p>One of the key features of the system is the ability to generate codebooks for all currently available waves and modules of the SHARE project in PDF format. This allows researchers to get an initial overview of the dataset’s content and case numbers without needing to download the data.</p>
<p>The <strong>&ldquo;Browse Publications&rdquo;</strong> tab includes all publications reported to SHARE Central, such as journal articles, books, book chapters, and other types of work like discussion papers or theses.</p>
<p>The <strong>&ldquo;Search&rdquo;</strong> function helps you quickly locate the information you need — whether across all areas, or specifically within datasets, questionnaires, or publications.</p>
<p>The tool is available at:<br>
