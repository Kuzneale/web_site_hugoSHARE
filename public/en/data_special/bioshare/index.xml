    <description>Collection of Biomarkers in Wave 10 in the Czech Republic To be specified later.&#xA;Accelerometer Study in Wave 8 in the Czech Republic In SHARE Wave 8, data on physical activity were collected by using accelerometers. A subsample of the panel respondents were asked to wear the device (Axivity AX3) for eight consecutive days (day and night) on their upper thigh.&#xA;The SHARE accelerometer study was conducted in ten countries: Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden. A detailed description of the study is available in the SHARE Wave 8 Methodology Volume. Raw accelerometer data is processed with GGIR and resulting measures are available in the Wave 8 gv_accelerometer modules. Provided metrics include vector magnitude (ENMO), intensity gradient, and LXMX measures. Additional datasets provide information on acceleration on epoch level (5 seconds) for each participant.</description>
