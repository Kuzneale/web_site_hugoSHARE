    <description>National Dropoff Questionnaire in Wave 9 The SHARE project also contains a paper-and-pencil questionnaire, the so-called dropoff, in which individual countries have an opportunity to ask questions that do not have to be harmonized with other countries and, therefore, enable asking questions about important local topics or conducting field experiments that would make no sense for other countries. Since 2011, we have been fortunate to include questions in cooperation with the Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports of the Czech Republic and the Research Institute of the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs on incentives for postponing retirement.Â After this positive experience we have decided, upon agreement with the project coordinator, to approach other research and academic institutions with the offer of the possibility to include questions according to their own choice and scientific intents. We are fortunate to offer you this research opportunity again for the last consecutive eight waves.</description>
