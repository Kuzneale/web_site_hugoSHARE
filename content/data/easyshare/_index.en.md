## *easy*SHARE (version 9.0.0)

*easy*SHARE is a simplified version of the SHARE database, designed primarily for researchers and students who are just starting with the analysis of complex longitudinal data.  
While the main SHARE database is split into dozens of files by wave, *easy*SHARE compiles information on all respondents across all countries and waves into a single dataset.

The data structure is much more user-friendly – information on respondents and their households is merged across all waves. Missing values are clearly classified and the dataset includes many derived variables (e.g., education level according to ISCED, health index, functional limitations, demographic and economic indicators).

*easy*SHARE is fully compatible with other ageing studies (such as HRS and ELSA) and supports **group registration** for university teaching purposes.

### Data Structure

The data are available as a single ZIP file containing information on respondents from all participating countries since 2004 (including the Czech Republic from 2006 onward). This format is ideal for teaching panel data analysis and for cross-country comparisons.

The archive also includes a Stata script used to create the *easy*SHARE file from the main database – allowing users to trace how the variables were derived and linked, and to adapt the code for their own research.
