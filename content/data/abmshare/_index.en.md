## Epidemiological Model abmSHARE

In collaboration with the Faculty of Biomedical Engineering at CTU and the company DNAi s.r.o., we have developed an **agent-based epidemiological model** called **abmSHARE**.

This model is able to use input data from both the **SHARE** project, **Eurostat**, or any external data, at the geographical level corresponding to **NUTS2** regions.

The goal of the model is to simulate the spread and impact of **Covid-19** and similar epidemiological scenarios.
