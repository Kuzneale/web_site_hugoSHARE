## SHARE Respondents in the Czech Republic  
### Data Protection & Confidentiality Notice

SHARE (Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe) is an international scientific study coordinated by the SHARE-ERIC consortium and national partners. In the Czech Republic, the study is implemented by the Czech Academy of Sciences (SHARE-CZ), and fieldwork is conducted by the Prague-based research agency SCaC. All procedures strictly comply with EU and Czech data protection laws.

The aim of SHARE is to gain a deeper understanding of the lives, health, and social and economic circumstances of individuals aged 50 and above. The collected data supports research and evidence-based policymaking. The Czech SHARE project is funded by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports and the European Commission.

Participants are randomly selected. Participation is entirely voluntary.

Your answers are anonymized ‚Äî your name or address will never be connected to your responses. This also applies to follow-up interviews or interviews with relatives of deceased participants. All data is linked only by an anonymous code, not personal identifiers.

**No identifying information is ever shared with third parties.**
